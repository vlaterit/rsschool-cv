			<h2>💁 About me</h2>
			<p>My goal in life is constant movement. I have many talents in me and the world is infinitely beautiful.
				And I try to know myself and the world around me to do more good, to be more helpful to people. My main
				strength is positivity. Every person is a priceless treasure and every circumstance in life is an
				opportunity to become a better person. Under his belt, he served in the army as an officer and has many
				years of experience in the field of supply and sales. I consider the most interesting case to be the
				development of a branch for the sale of industrial equipment from scratch. Due to the circumstances, I
				had to move to another country and I took it as an opportunity to learn new things. As a result, I
				became an RS School student in front-end development.
